## Overview and Project Goals
Welcome to the Turing Tip Jar - where students and alum can choose to simply peruse tips, or can leave tips to help others wade the trecherous Turing waters! 

The goal of this Mod3 group [project](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-3/stretch.html) was to stretch boundaries and branch out on our own to teach ourselves new tech. We chose to dive into the backend technologies. We built our own server using express and built a database using PostgreSQL. We deployed our database to Heroku and built our frontend using React.

### Learning Goals

To solidify and demonstrate the understanding of:

- The ability to independently learn a new technology
- Building a server through Express
- Establishing and seeding a database using PostgreSQL
- Deploying a database
- Building a frontend using React to display data
